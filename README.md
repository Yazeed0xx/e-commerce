# e-commernce

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, Express, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Express** - Fast, unopinionated web framework
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **MySQL** - Database engine
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
## Database Setup

This project uses MySQL with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have a MySQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your MySQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:
```bash
npm run db:push
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
